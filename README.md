# Face analysis using DeepFace on images

## Overview

This notebook has the usage of the DeepFace library to analyze faces in images. The analysis includes detecting faces and predicting gender and emotions. The processed images are displayed with rectangles around the faces, color-coded based on gender, and the dominant emotion is shown in lila-colored text.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Automatically detects faces in images.

- **Gender Prediction**: Predicts the gender of detected faces and draws a rectangle around the face:
  - **Pink Rectangle**: Indicates the predicted gender is "Woman."
  - **Blue Rectangle**: Indicates the predicted gender is "Man."
  
- **Emotion Prediction**: Displays the dominant emotion of each detected face with its corresponding probability, shown in lila-colored text.

- **Multi-Face Support**: Handles and displays results for multiple faces in a single image.

## Images

Images depicting brawls in local, federal, and national parliaments in Turkey, Ukraine, Kovacs, Jordan, Italy, Uganda, India, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, and the United States are showcased.

## Outcome

The face recognition, gender identification, and emotion prediction tasks are all performing poorly.
